Java EE with 'Conversations' overview:
	Having a client platform for service providers which can be installed locally 
	and logged in to via secure connection would allow the distribution of a 
	portal through which to interact with customers. Customers could interact 
	with the service through either a distributed platform, or a more preferable 
	option would be for customers to access the service through a web browser 
	with secure login. Information regarding client and customer would be 
	accessed through Java EE servers. 

Web Application Lifecycle:
	1. Develop the web component code.
	2. Develop the web application deployment descriptor, if necessary.
	3. Compile the web application components and helper classes referenced
		by the components.
	4. Optionally, package the application into a deployable unit.
	5. Deploy the application into a web container.
	6. Access a URL that references the web application.
